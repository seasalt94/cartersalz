      <description>As part of an effort to get back to engineering, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to take on small projects or hobby things that make me think through a design - from idea to build I just want to make things. This was an idea I saw a couple different places online and thought it could be a nice and easy little hardware project. I liked the idea too because there are a lot of different ways you can build off of it: add programmable RGB LEDs, make the frame geometry more complex, add sensors/ functionality to the display, etc.</description>

      <description>455 days ago today I started work at a fairly large medical software company in Madison, Wisconsin. About 3 weeks in I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be there1 very long.
This is something I did in high school. It took me awhile to figure out - and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even work right yet - but hey it&amp;rsquo;s mine. I wrote it; that&amp;rsquo;s what this is supposed to be all about.</description>
