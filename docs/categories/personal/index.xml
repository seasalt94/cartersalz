      <description>455 days ago today I started work at a fairly large medical software company in Madison, Wisconsin. About 3 weeks in I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be there1 very long.
Anyway its 1am now, maybe day 456 will be better.
 There? Here? Hard to say which is right but I&amp;rsquo;m still here as of today. !   </description>
