      <description>455 days ago today I started work at a fairly large medical software company in Madison, Wisconsin. About 3 weeks in I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be there1 very long.
This is something I did in high school. It took me awhile to figure out - and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even work right yet - but hey it&amp;rsquo;s mine. I wrote it; that&amp;rsquo;s what this is supposed to be all about.</description>
