      <description>As part of an effort to get back to engineering, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to take on small projects or hobby things that make me think through a design - from idea to build I just want to make things. This was an idea I saw a couple different places online and thought it could be a nice and easy little hardware project. I liked the idea too because there are a lot of different ways you can build off of it: add programmable RGB LEDs, make the frame geometry more complex, add sensors/ functionality to the display, etc.</description>
